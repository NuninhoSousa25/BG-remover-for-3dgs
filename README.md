to do
- ui  - below the preview, "current - image name"
- add export settings,
    - color / alpha 0
    - color / black
    - white /black
output folder location should be picable, inside input folder or under the same directory

need better logging and error handeling

ui need scroll , 
and preview needs better click to drag instead of scrol to drag,
