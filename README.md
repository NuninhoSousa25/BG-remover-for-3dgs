# BG-remover-for-3dgs

to do

realityscan exports images rotated 90ยบ can we do the same?

i need to correct somthing, output folder should be called "masks"
- i need to be able to pick if its inside input folder or under the same directory
-also need to pick from "original_filename" vs "original filename_mask" and if its under a sub folder or just there in the same directory as the originals

need better logging and error handeling

and preview needs better control and sensitivity  currently is too laggy and sensitive

# Batch Background Removal Tool

A desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux designed for batch processing images to remove their backgrounds. The tool is built with Python and Tkinter, leveraging the powerful `rembg` library for AI-powered background segmentation. It is optimized for CPU-only execution to ensure it runs on a wide variety of machines without requiring a dedicated GPU.

## Features

*   **Batch Processing:** Process entire folders of images in one go.
*   **AI Model Selection:** Choose from different models (`u2netp`, `u2net`, etc.) to balance speed and quality.
*   **Advanced Export Options:**
    *   Save images with a transparent background (PNG).
    *   Save images with a solid white or black background.
    *   Generate black and white **alpha masks** for professional workflows (e.g., for Reality Capture, After Effects).
*   **Flexible Output Control:**
    *   Specify output location: inside the source folder, next to the source folder, or in any custom directory.
    *   Customize subfolder names and filename suffixes (e.g., `image_mask.png`).
*   **Performance Tuning:**
    *   Adjust the number of CPU threads and set a memory limit to manage resource usage.
    *   Enable/disable pre-resizing to speed up processing on large images.
*   **Live Preview:** See a preview of the processed image with your current settings before running a full batch.
*   **EXIF Orientation Fix:** Automatically reads and corrects for image rotation metadata, ensuring masks align perfectly with source photos from phones and cameras.

## Requirements

This script is built with Python 3. You will need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

The script relies on several external Python libraries. They are listed below and can be installed easily using the instructions in the next section.

*   `Pillow`: For all image manipulation.
*   `rembg`: The core library for background removal.
*   `onnxruntime`: The AI model inference engine required by `rembg`.
*   `psutil`: For monitoring system CPU and memory usage.
*   `piexif`: For reading and writing EXIF metadata to fix image orientation issues.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the tool and install all necessary libraries.

#### Step 1: Get the Project Files

First, make sure you have the `bg_removal_tool.py` script on your computer. If you have `git` installed, you can clone the repository. Otherwise, simply download the files.

#### Step 2: Create a `requirements.txt` File

In the same directory as your `bg_removal_tool.py` script, create a new text file named `requirements.txt` and paste the following content into it. This file lists all the required libraries and their versions.

```text
Pillow>=9.0.0
rembg>=2.0.50
onnxruntime>=1.15.0
psutil>=5.9.0
piexif>=1.1.3
```

#### Step 3: Install the Libraries

Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and navigate to the directory where you saved the project files.

Run the following command to install all the libraries listed in `requirements.txt` in one go.

**Recommended Command (More Reliable):**

*   On **Windows**:
    ```bash
    py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

*   On **macOS / Linux**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Using `py -m` or `python3 -m` is recommended as it ensures you are using the `pip` that corresponds to your Python installation, avoiding conflicts if you have multiple versions of Python.)*

**Standard Command:**

If the above command gives you trouble, you can try the simpler version:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the installation is complete without errors, you are ready to run the application.

## Usage

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Run the application with the following command:

    *   On **Windows**:
        ```bash
        py bg_removal_tool.py
        ```
    *   On **macOS / Linux**:
        ```bash
        python3 bg_removal_tool.py
        ```

3.  **Using the Tool:**
    *   Click "**Browse...**" to select your input folder containing the images.
    *   Adjust the **Export Settings**, **CPU Settings**, and **Model Settings** on the left as needed.
    *   Click the "**Scan Folder**" button. This will populate the file list on the right.
    *   Click on any file in the list to see a live preview based on your current settings.
    *   To process all images, click "**Process All**". To process only the selected image, click "**Process Selected Image**".
